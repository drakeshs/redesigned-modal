# CNBC Modal Challenge

React Coding Challenge for Front End Developers

## Instructions

You will be creating a custom modal! Within that modal you will be creating a form with a few inputs, and then once the form is ready you'll use it to pass data to the state object.

### [TODO A]

- [ ] Navigate to App.js and notice you have a modal component in between the logo and the text. The modal is closed by default. Create a button that will launch our modal and launch it. Make sure to give it a hover and clicked state so the user has some assurance that something is happening when interacting with this button.

- [ ] You will see a close button in the top right of the modal. When the user clicks the button the modal and backdrop should disappear and the body should be scrollable, also if the user clicks the backdrop the modal and backdrop should disappear and the body should be scrollable.

### [TODO B]

- [ ] You will see some fields already present on the modal component. Create a field that is a select menu and populate it using the occupations array in occupations.json located in the root of this project

- [ ] For the password field add a toggle functionality to show the password as text or as dots.

- [ ] Create a submit button as part of this form. Make sure to give it a hover and clicked state so the user has some assurance that something is happening when interacting with this button.

- [ ] When the user clicks the submit button the modal and backdrop should disappear and the body should be scrollable.

### [TODO D]

- [ ] If the form can be submitted successfully pass that data into the state object and then log the state.

### [BONUS]

- [] make sure your form and fields comply with accessibility standards

- [ ] Add validation to the form. All fields should be required and should display an error message on submit if the value(s) are empty.
